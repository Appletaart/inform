* You could use a searching bar or click on the map to choose the municipalities that you would like to discovery.
* For clicking on the map, you could switch the result bar from right to left.
* A bit of a gimmick. The result from the searching bar always stays on the right hand side. If you click on the map first then choose another municipality by using a searching bar. then switch bar from right to left. It could be possible to compare 2 municipalities at the same time..
